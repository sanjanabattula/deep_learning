# Deep Learning Projects

This repository includes a collection of deep learning projects in natural language processing, image classification, and adversarial machine learning. Each project demonstrates core concepts and techniques using modern deep learning tools and frameworks.

## Project Overview

### 1. Fine-Tuning RoBERTa with AdaLoRA
This project applies parameter-efficient fine-tuning using Adaptive Low-Rank Adaptation (AdaLoRA) on the `roberta-base` model for multi-class text classification. The model is trained on the AG News dataset to classify news articles into four categories.

- Location: `LoRA_finetuning/`

### 2. LiteResNet
LiteResNet is a lightweight convolutional neural network based on the ResNet architecture. It is optimized for efficient image classification with fewer parameters while maintaining strong performance. The project includes model training, fine-tuning, and test-time augmentation.

- Location: `LiteResNet/`

### 3. Adversarial Attacks on Deep Learning Models
This project implements and evaluates adversarial attack methods on a ResNet-34 classifier trained on the ImageNet-1K dataset. Techniques include FGSM, iterative attacks, patch-based attacks, and transferability analysis.

- Location: `Adversarial_attacks/`

Each project folder contains its own `README.md` with setup instructions, implementation details, and usage examples.
